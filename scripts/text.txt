the most painful goodbyes are the ones \nthat were never explained or expected
the eyes are useless when the mind is blind
I've always loved the idea of not being \nwhat people expect me to be
I fall in love with souls, not faces
Your heart will never lie to you.\nThat's your brains job.
I hope you find someone who knows\nhow to love you, when you are sad.
You are ripped at every edge,\nbut you are a masterpiece
Everything has changes and yet,\nI'm more me than I've ever been.
It's never too late to love yourself again.
Want to know what someone fears losing?\nWatch what they photograph
Maybe everything was means to be this way.
Why is it so easy to kill our happiness.\nbut so hard to kill our sadness?
We ignore truths for temporary happiness.
I just want a clear mind and a happy heart.
Some hearts understand each\nother even in silence.
I'm tired of meeting the same people\nin different bodies.
No one is you and that is your power.
I think the hardest person to love is yourself.
The end
