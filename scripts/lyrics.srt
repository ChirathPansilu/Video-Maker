Luis Fonsi - Despacito ( cover by J.Fla )

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,160
Yes, you know that I've been looking at you for a while

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,440
I have to dance with you today

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,620
I saw, that your gaze was already inviting me

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,660
Show me the way and I will go

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,620
Youâ€¦ you are like a magnet and I'm metal

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,380
I'm getting closer and I'm setting up the plan

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,100
Just the thought of it raises my heartbeat

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,720
Now, now I'm liking it more than normal

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,580
All my senses are asking for more

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,400
This should be taken without a rush

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,880
Slowly

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,420
I want to breathe slowly on your neck slowly

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,380
Let me whisper things in your ears

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,220
So that you remember when you're not with me

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,780
Slowly

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,400
I want to undress you with kisses slowly

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,120
Sign the walls of your maze

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,740
And make your whole body a manuscript

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,820
I wanna see your hair dance

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,560
I wanna be your rhythm

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,040
That you to teach my mouth all your favorite places

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,520
Let me overtake your danger zones

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,220
To make you scream and forget your own last name

25
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,180
Slowly

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,400
Slowly

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,840
I want to breathe slowly on your neck slowly

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,860
Let me whisper things in your ears

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
So that you remember when you're not with me

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,380
Slowly

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,840
I want to strip your kisses slowly

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,680
Sign the walls of your maze

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,800
And make your whole body a manuscript

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,280
Oh, I wanna see your hair dance

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,340
I wanna be your rhythm

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,960
I want you to teach my mouth

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,140
Your favorite places

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,980
Let me overtake your danger zones

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,940
To make you scream and forget your own last name

40
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,240
Slowly
